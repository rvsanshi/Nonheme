Test.ipynb is used to test the predictive performance of molecular fingerprints and new fingerprints combining molecular fingerprints with 3D descriptors.
3Ddescriptor. ipynb is used to test the predictive performance of 3D descriptors
3DVSMorgan.ipynb is used to compare the performance of Morgan fingerprints and 3D descriptors in predicting BDE of the isomeric bonds.
The data file contains the sdf folder and BDE. csv file. The sdf folder contains the M folder and the M2000 folder.
The M file contains the V3000 version of the sdf file used for molecular fingerprint calculation.
The M2000 folder contains the sdf file of V2000 version, which is used for calculating 3D descriptors. 
The BDE. csv file contains keys and corresponding dialatic BDE information.
The trainBDE.csv contains the bond information for non-isomers
